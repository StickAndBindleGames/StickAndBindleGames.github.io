Hi, and welcome. My name is Tyran and you've found my portfolio of personal and professional projects

## Personal Projects:

#Procedural Music Generator
A personal project developed in mid-2017. Available on the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/99791). Originally developed for personal use in my games, but it was handy and neat, so released publicly in September 2017.
