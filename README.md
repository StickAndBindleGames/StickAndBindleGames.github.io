## **Personal Projects:**

### [Procedural Music Generator](https://stickandbindlegames.github.io/ProceduralMusicPlayer_Win/)  
A personal project developed in mid-2017. Available on the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/99791). Originally developed for personal use in my games, but it was handy and neat, so I developed a more robust user interface and additional features and released publicly in September 2017.  Developed in C#. Working with music theory and sound provided many unique challenges to overcome, but it was a great learning experience for creative programming, UI design and music theory.
